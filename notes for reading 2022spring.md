    8) Black box and glass box testing:
            "Black box testing means choosing test cases only from the specification, not the implementation of the function. That’s what we’ve been doing in our examples so far. We partitioned and looked for boundaries in abs, max, and BigInt multiplication without looking at the actual code for these functions. In fact, if we were following the test-first programming approach, we hadn’t even written the code for these functions yet."
            "Glass box testing means choosing test cases with knowledge of how the function is actually implemented. For example, if the implementation selects different algorithms depending on the input, then you should partition around the points where different algorithms are chosen. If the implementation keeps an internal cache that remembers the answers to previous inputs, then you should test repeated inputs."
